# Dark Forest Token Market
A plugin which allows darkforest players to sell their artifacts to each other in game.  
The contract should be able to get reused over multiple rounds  
Relies on [my subgraph](https://github.com/ZK-farts/DF-market-subgraph) and [the darkforest subgraph](https://github.com/darkforest-eth/eth/tree/master/subgraph) as well as obviously [Dark Forest](https://github.com/darkforest-eth).  
#  TODO (help appreciated)

 -  Make the smart contract better
 - Make sure many tokens can display at once in UI
 - UI should refresh when you buy or sell a token
 - Better docs / comments
 - Maybe remake the whole frontend (its slow)
